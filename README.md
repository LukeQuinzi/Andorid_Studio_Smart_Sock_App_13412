# Repository Description

Code developed for the Honours Project EEE-13412 (2021) at the University of Adelaide: The Smart Sock for Aiding Prosthesis Fit and Preventing Pressure Sores in Leg Amputees

This repository contains code used in the previously mentioned Honours Project undertaken at the University of Adelaide. In this repository you will find Android Studio files including Java classes and XML layout files used to accomplish the apps functionality. The main features of the App include a sign up and login page that stores user on a data base file on the mobile device and a remember me feature that prevents users having to reproduce their name at the login page. It also includes a Bluetooth user interface that is able to detect and connect to other Bluetooth networks and receive data in the Textview on the 2D array pressure map. It also includes a colour coded 2D array graphical representation using a library called Anychart. 

The apps’ purpose was to interface pressure measurements from a pressure sensing device that measured the pressure between a lower limb amputees’ residual limb and their prosthetic. The pressure map provides an interface that clinicians are able to quickly determine where the high-pressure areas are located on the residual limb. The pressure device that as used was an array pressure sensor, hence the array pressure map that was used on the mobile app. Also, a firebeetle ESP32 microcontroller was used and the app was communicating with he microcontroller via serial-to-serial Bluetooth communication.


For reference purposes images of the interfaces have been provided below.
